# Heap-Selection

This is an implementation of the algorithms presented in *An Optimal Algorithm for Selection in a Min-Heap*, by Greg N. Frederickson, 1993.

It is part of the master thesis of Kenn Daniel and Casper FÃ¦rgemand.

The algorithms are written in C++11 and successfully compiled with g++ 5.3.0.

Feel free to fork and improve. Our template skills are subpar and the generality of the implementation could be improved substantially.
